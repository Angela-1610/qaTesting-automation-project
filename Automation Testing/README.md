I used Selenium WebDriver to automate and execute my test script. Upon launching the application using Chrome WebDriver, I tested the functionality of adding an item to the list and marking specific items as completed. During the process, I observed that when an item is marked, it is automatically removed from the list. As a result, I was unable to explicitly test the delete function due to the behavior of the specific website used. However, if the application under test had a separate delete button, the same testing approach would applyâ€”locating and interacting with the appropriate element using its ID, class name, or other selectors depending on the DOM structure of the website.
